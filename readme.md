## Independent Practice

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Using the [starter code](/starter-code), create a controller `pages` with three different methods "everyone", "logged_in" and "logged_out".

- The method `everyone` should be accessible for every visitor
- the method `logged_in` should be accessed only by the people that are logged in
- the method `denis` can only be accessed for the user with name `denis`

Tip: You can have several before_action per controller.

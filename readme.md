## Independent Practice

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Using the [starter code](starter-code), create a controller `pages` with three different methods "everyone", "logged_in" and "logged_out".

The method "everyone" should be accessible for every visitor, the method logged_in should be accessed only by the people that are logged_in, and the method logged_out can only be accessed for users **NOT** logged_in.

Tip: You can have several before_action per controller.
